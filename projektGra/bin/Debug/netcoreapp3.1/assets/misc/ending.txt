And so, you finally got yourself out of those cursed mountains.
Things slowly started to go back to normal.
You stopped seeing monkeys everywhere.
And all other strange landscapes were gone at last.
You smiled.
Being so glad, that you're still alive.
And one day you will tell this story,
About how you escaped this deadly place,
To your kids and grandkids.
...
(Assuming you will have any)
