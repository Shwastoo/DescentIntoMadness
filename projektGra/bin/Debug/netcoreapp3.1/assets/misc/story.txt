It was a peaceful day in Madness Mountains.
You went there alone to relax.
The name of this place sounded just about right for that.
Actually, you never thought why are these mountains called that way.
Everything was perfect.
Until you stumbled upon some very strange mist.
Once you saw it, and breathed it, it was everywhere.
And then strange things started to happen.
You began to see absurd and unreal things.
You slowly started to lose your mind.
You immediately thought, that you have to descend back down.
And so your adventure begins...
